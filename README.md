# Jitsi Meet - Secure, Simple and Scalable Video Conferences

This repository is a fork of the official Jitsi Meet repository (https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet). Most of the features contained in this fork come from the original repository. A few additional custom features have been added for an Ivicos Jitsi Meet version. The deployment/release process has also been adapted.
The documentation for the features can be found in `doc/ivicos` and the usage is described in `USAGE.md` (repository setup and deployment procedure).

An extract of the README of the original repository has been pasted below.
The full content is available here : https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet.

## Introduction

Jitsi Meet is an open-source (Apache) WebRTC JavaScript application that uses [Jitsi Videobridge](https://jitsi.org/videobridge) to provide high quality, [secure](https://jitsi.org/security) and scalable video conferences. Jitsi Meet in action can be seen at [here at the session #482 of the VoIP Users Conference](http://youtu.be/7vFUVClsNh0).

## Acknowledgements

Jitsi Meet started out as a sample conferencing application using Jitsi Videobridge. It was originally developed by ESTOS' developer Philipp Hancke who then contributed it to the community where development continues with joint forces!
